<!--The purpose of this exercise is to define the learning content in your game.
You need to choose what subject you are going to teach (mathematics, programming,
history, ethics, finance, etc.), what age group you are targeting, and what 
specific aspects of that subject you are going to tackle. You need to show that
you understand the educational aspects of this course, especially learning 
trajectories and the gradual, stairstep nature of teaching / learning a 
subject.-->
We will begin assuming the child playing this game at a third grade level in mathematics. So, the target user will have familiarity with addition, subtraction, and basic multiplication. The end goal is that they will strengthen these skills, become proficient at mental multiplication of two numbers up to 12 and understand the concept of remainder or the mod of a number. We will start very basic introducing the game mechanics, basic arithmetic, and the idea of a number being a multiple of another. With each level increase we marginally increase the difficulty be either making the numbers we deal with larger, or adding a new concept. Whenever we add a new concept, we go back to using small numbers and ten build back up.

<!--You are going to present a design that is more complete than what you are going
to be expected to implement. For your design, imaging that you have a full
design and implementation team, so implementation time is not a constraint. 
You will later carve out a subset of this design to complete for this course.-->

The game is called space racer and the player is in control of a spaceship called mod k (where k is an integer). The student must traverse a map, which is pretty linear, but the conflict is their spaceship will run out of energy unless they go through certain charging gates. Each charging gate is of type n. Depending on the level, the student must go through a gate that is a multiple of k, or gives you some remainder r when divided by k (depending on the level). Also, the student can change the number of the gate by firing and hitting the gate with their laser.

<!--Diagram a learning trajectory for this subject that starts with existing relevant
skills on the left-most side and progresses through knowledge they would learn
in a game like yours (your game won't need to cover all of this).-->

<!--Describe your sources and methodology for creating your learning trajectory. It
cannot be just made up yourself - you need to draw upon existing examples or 
justify the reasons why you have created it in that way.-->

As stated above, we advanced the difficulty slowly, each way building upon something previously known, in order to achieve new skills. Multiplication of larger composite numbers can be thought of as multiplying their factors. For instance, 4*7 = 2*(2*7). We derived the idea for our ordering from common core, having the building blocks of multiplication be introduced first and then relying on said skills later on with larger numbers. We also took a lot of inspiration from "K-8 Learning Trajectories Derived from Research Literature: Sequence, Repetition, Conditionals" in designing our trajectory, specifically the idea of a spiral curricula. Each level relates and uses skills on some previous level besides or known knowledge. We start by introducing and having the student see modulo in a very basic setting and our end result is the student will understand and be able to see what n mod k of a number is.
