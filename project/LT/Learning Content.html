<!--The purpose of this exercise is to define the learning content in your game.
You need to choose what subject you are going to teach (mathematics, programming,
history, ethics, finance, etc.), what age group you are targeting, and what 
specific aspects of that subject you are going to tackle. You need to show that
you understand the educational aspects of this course, especially learning 
trajectories and the gradual, stairstep nature of teaching / learning a 
subject.-->
We will begin assuming the child playing this game at at a third grade level in mathematics. So, the target user will have familiarity with addition, subtraction, and basic multiplication. The end goal is that they will strengthen these skills, become profient at mental multiplicatoin of two numbers up to 12 and understand the concept of remainder or the mod of a number. We will start very basic introducing the game mechanics, basic arithmetic, and the idea of a number being a multiple of another. With each level increase we marginally increase teh difficulty be either making the numbers we deal with larger, or adding a new concept. Whenever we add a new concept, we go back to using small numbers and ten build back up.

<!--You are going to present a design that is more complete than what you are going
to be expected to implement. For your design, imaging that you have a full
design and implementation team, so implementation time is not a constraint. 
You will later carve out a subset of this design to complete for this course.-->

The game is called space racer and the player is in control of a spaceship called mod k (where k is an interger). The student must traverse a map, which is pretty linear, but the conflict is their spaceship will runout of energy unless they go through certain charging gates. Each charging gate is of type n. Depending on the level, the student must go through a gate that is a multiple of k, or gives you some remainder r when divided by k (depending on the level). Also, the student can change the number of the gate by firing and hitting the gate with their laser.

Keep in all the html. Place in your design directory of your repository. 
You and your partner fill in your CNETIDs - you only need to submit to one of your
svn repositories.
<br><br>
Summarize your content area in 1-2 paragraphs.
<br><br>
Describe the age of your user and the skills that you assume the user already has 
(that is relevant to your content). Your user must be in at least 3rd grade.
<br><br>
Describe what skills you are going to teach your user.

<!--Diagram a learning trajectory for this subject that starts with existing relevant
skills on the left-most side and progresses through knowledge they would learn
in a game like yours (your game won't need to cover all of this).-->

<!--Describe your sources and methodology for creating your learning trajectory. It
cannot be just made up yourself - you need to draw upon existing examples or 
justify the reasons why you have created it in that way.-->

As stated above, we advanced the difficulty slowly, each way building upon something previosly known, in order to achieve new skills. We took a lot of inspiration from "K-8 Learning Trajectories Derived from Research Literature: Sequence, Repetition, Conditionals" in designing our trajectory, specifically spiral curricula. Each level relates and uses skills on some previous level besides or known knowledge. And
